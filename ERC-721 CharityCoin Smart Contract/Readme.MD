Crypto Charity is a proposed decentralized platform which enables donors to safely donate CryptoCurrency (in our case Ethers) for various non-profit organizations.

Smart Contract Objective: 
This is an ERC721 based Ethereum smart contract which issues a Non-Fungible Token â€“ CharityCoin for the users. The users can transfer, buy and sell coins using the contract.

The tokens are designed to exchange the NF token for swag items such as mousepads, coffee mugs, caps, t-shirts, bags, jackets etc. in the CryptoCharity Platform.

The end objective of issuing the CharityCoin tokens is to motivate users to donate more and market the CryptoCharity platform by issuing the swag items to donors.

Scope:
The smart contract will be written in Solidity in Remix IDE importing ERC721 standard from Openzeppelin. It will be deployed in Truffle and tested using truffle test.
